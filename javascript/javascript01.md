1. Javascript is an intepreter language. 


2. Javascript intepreter(engine) is normally included  in the browsers.

 
3. Why do we use variable? 

	- Variables can be reused. 


4. Creating a variable. 

	create variable name a 
	
	var a;
	var a = 10 + 20;  


	or 

	var a = 10 + 20;   // 30  


5.  Javascript and Python are both interpreted language.
 

6.  Javascript Datatypes: 

	- String 
	- Numbers 
	- Booleans (true or false) 
	- Undefined 
	- Null 
	- Symbol
	- Object -> objective / referencing 

	
	primitive types - > String, Numbers, Booleans, Undefined, Null, Symbol 

	primitives are pretty much immutable type.


7. Javascript runs variable hoisting.

	- Tried to prevent errors beforehand.
	- (let and const) are recommended usage in the modern programming.
	
	
	Tip : variables are often cause of errors when running the programming. 	      assigned variables can be re-assigned by the others. 

	      Hence, const can be used to prevent the status changes or re-assig	      nment

	


8. Naming a variable should be meaningful. The name of variable should be repres   enting the variable's nature.



9. Variable names are case-sensitive. 


10. Javascript naming variable convention basically follows to put lowercase. 
    However, if the name is mixed between lower and upper case, 

	carmel case can be used to name the variable. 
	e.g. getName, stateBuilding 

	Also, pascal case is used to name the variables. 
	e.g. GetName, StateBuilding 

	Lastly, snake case is used to name the variables. 
	e.g. get_name, state_building 


11. In javascript, strings can be declared using '' or "" or ``. 

	e.g. 

	let name = '' ; 
	name = "aaa" ; 
	name = ``; 

	
	Single quotation mark could be the basic way to put up the string. 

12. String interpretation 

	e.g. name = 'lee'; 
	     console.log(name) 
	     console.log(`Hi, ${name}.`)
