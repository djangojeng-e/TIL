# Data Strucutre	



**Organising, managing and storing** data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allow you to organise your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. 



**Python has Built-in Data Structures** 

List, Dictionary, Tuple, Sets 



**Python has User-Defined Data Structures**

Arrays or List, Stack, Queue, Tress, Linked Lists, Graphs and Hashmaps.

# Lists



Lists are used to store data of **different data types in a sequential manner.** There are addresses assigned to every element of the list which is called index. Index starts from 0. 



**Adding elements**



```python
list = []
list.append()
list.extend()
list.insert(1, i)
```



**Deleting** **Elements****



```python
my_list = []

del my_list[]  # Delete element at index 5 
my_list.pop()  # Delete the last element and remove it. 
my_list.remove('') # Removes the element with value 
my_list.clear() # empty the list 

```

**Other Functions**



```python
len(list) # returns the length of the list. 
index() 	# finds the index value of value passed where it has been encountered the first time. 
count() # Finds the count of the value passed to it. 
sorted() # this is a return type sort the values of the list  
sort() # this modifies the original list. 

```



# Dictionary



Dictionaries are used to store **key-value** pairs. Think of a phone book directory where hundreds of names have the corresponding numbers.
