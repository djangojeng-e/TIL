# Modules 



As your program gets longer, splitting the program into several files for easier maintenance might come into issue.  Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. These files are called a **module.**



Modules can be imported into other modules or in to the main module. (The collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode.)



**A module is a file containing Python definitions and Statements**
