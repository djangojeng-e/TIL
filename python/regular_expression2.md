Today, I revisited regular expression again. 

The main Regularexpression I faced again today were the followings. 

\w - letters (Match alphanumeric character including "-") 
\W - letters (Match alphanumeric character excluding "_")
\s - space (tab, space, newline etc)

<.*> Greedy repetion matches as much text as possible.
