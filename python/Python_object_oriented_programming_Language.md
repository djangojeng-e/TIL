 Python is an object oriented programming language. 



* Everything is treated as an object like functions, modules, data types etc. 



Class is a blueprint of a data that defines the characteristics and behaviour of its data members and member functions and an object is an instance of the class. 



In Object Oriented Programming (OOP) objects are used to store data and functions defined inside a class. 



A class is just a blueprint which doesn't occupy any memory until it is instantiated. The instance of the class is called object. 





**Python objects are automatically garbage collected when the last reference to the object is gone. This happens automatically.** 



# Object Oriented Programming 



Older programming languages were structured such that data could be accessed by any module of the code. This could lead to potential security issues. 



This made developers to **move over to Object-Oriented Programming that could help us emulate real-world examples into code** such that better solutions could be obtained. 



**4 Main concepts of OOPS** 



- **Inheritance** - allows us to derive attributes and methods from the parent class and modify them as per the requirement. 
- **Encapsulation** - binding data and objects together such that other objects and classed do not access the data. Python has private, protected and public types whose names suggest what they do. Python uses '-' or '__' to specify private or protected keywords. 
- **Polymorphism** - This allows us to have a **common interface for various types of data**. You can have similar function names with different data passed to them 
- **Abstraction**- Abstraction can be used to **simplify complex reality by modelling classes** appropriate to the problem.
