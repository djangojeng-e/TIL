 Python is an object oriented programming language. 



* Everything is treated as an object like functions, modules, data types etc. 



Class is a blueprint of a data that defines the characteristics and behaviour of its data members and member functions and an object is an instance of the class. 



In Object Oriented Programming (OOP) objects are used to store data and functions defined inside a class. 



A class is just a blueprint which doesn't occupy any memory until it is instantiated. The instance of the class is called object. 





**Python objects are automatically garbage collected when the last reference to the object is gone. This happens automatically.**
