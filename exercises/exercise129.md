Differentiate between Django, Pyramid and Flask. 

These are three major web frameworks in Python. 

- We can use Django for a relatively large applications with ORM. 
- Flask is a microframework for a small platform with simpler requirements.
It is ready to use and you must use external libraries. 
- The pyramid is for larger applications. It is flexible and you can choose the database, the URL strucutre, the templating style, and much more. 
It is also heavily configurable.
