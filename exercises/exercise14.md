Refer to the solution created by djangojeng-e in .py format. exercise14.py


Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

    Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
    Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
