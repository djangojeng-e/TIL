Q.40. What is pickling and unpickling?

To create portable serialized representations of Python objects, we have the module 'pickle'. It accepts a Python object (remember, everything in Python is an object). It then converts it into a string representation and uses the dump() function to dump it into a file. 

We call this pickling. 

In contrast, retrieving objects from this stored string representation is termed 'unpickling'.
