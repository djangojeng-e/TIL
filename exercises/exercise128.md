What is unit testing? How will you do it in Python? 

This is the first level of software testing, and it focuses on testing individual units of source code. 

This is to make sure everything works as expected. A unit is the smallest testable part of a software and usually comprises of a few inputs and a single output. 

For this, we have the unittest framework. This was inspired by the JUnit framework and offers support for test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of tests from the framework. 


unittest is about text fixtures, text cases, text suites and test runners.
