#Today I learned about getter/setter and property in class. 

# Some program languages supports private objective property that does not allow#  direct access from external sources
 

- Programmers use getter method and setter method to read and write private property values. 

- In python, we do not need getter or setter methods. 
- Because, all properties and methods are public and they operate as expected. 

- However, if you find it uncomfortable with direct access to these properties ffrom external sources, you can still use getter or setter methods. 

#Pythonically, we can use property. 

- The other way to declare property is to use decorators. 

	e.g. @ property 
	     @ name.setter 


- Properties can reference to calculated values.
