# Setting Up Database on AWS 



# 

**In order to use MySQL instead of using SQLite, we can use RDS service provided by AMAZON WEB SERVICES**



AWS maintains server centres across different regions in the world. The closer to the server centres from our area gives faster response speed. Therefore, the region has to be set as the closest region from the area we live in.
